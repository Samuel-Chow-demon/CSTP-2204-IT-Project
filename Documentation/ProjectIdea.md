## <span style="color: rgb(114, 207, 166);">3. Background
- ### <span style="text-align: justify;"> Finding public parking space constantly is a challenge for drivers, especially at the high-demand or popular area like commerical center, arena or community-oriented areas. People often need to drive to the parking area before realizing whether there are any vanact space available. This inconvenience inspires the idea of a web application that provides real-time parking space detection and statistical services. </span>

## <span style="color: rgb(114, 207, 166);">4. Application Overviews
### Provide real-time parking vacancy statistic on different location (public parking area)
 - Through APP UI Dashboard
 - Through API request by third-party application

- ### 8.1 Object Detection by YOLO
    - YOLO (You Only Look Once) model is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture designed specifically for real-time object detection

    - YOLO is built on a Convolutional Neural Network backbone. The CNN layers extract spatial features from the image, such as edges, shapes, and textures, and use them to detect and classify objects.



    ### Key components:
    - <u>A. Convolutional Layers</u>

        - These layers extract features like object boundaries textures, and patterns. YOLO uses a backbone network (e.g., Darknet, CSPNet, or others) as the feature extractor.

    - <u>B. Feature Maps</u>

        - The convolutional layers output feature maps, which are grids representing the image's spatial information and depth (channels).

    - <u>C. Bounding Box Prediction</u> 

        - The network divides the image into an SÃ—S grid and predicts bounding boxes, class probabilities, and confidence scores for each grid cell.

- ### 8.2 Google Colab
    - Making use of google provided cloud GPU engine linux instance for YOLO model training

    - jupyter notebook platform (Python)

- ### 8.3 FireStore (NoSQL Database)
- ### 8.4 API Key Serialization, Salting And Validation
- ### 8.5 Amazon Web Service (AWS) Deployment
- ### 8.6 Data Image Acquisition by Drone
